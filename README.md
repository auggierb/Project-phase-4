 # Pokemon Card Finder 
 

 For my project I made a pokemon card finder. It has a search feature and and a person user deck table for 

adding cards to your deck/shopping list. In the deck table you can update the quantity of cards you want and remove cards from your list.

## Installation
 
 to start the backend: run rails s to run the frontend: npm start --prefix client

 bundle install can be run to download dependencies. 

 ## Road Map

 hopefully comments will be implimented along with more subclass filtering for types, prices. 

 user decks will have their own filters as well.
